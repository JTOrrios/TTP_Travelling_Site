        <p class="quote">We were here for two full days and one night last year. The place itself was awesome with all the swimming pools, inside "jungles", restaurants, spa's etc. It was reasonably cheap to eat and enjoy few drinks there. You do not need cash there because
            it's all working with a bracelet they give you. We will definitely return there someday!</p>

        <p class="quote">I love tropical island. Actually it is not so full and you find a place to rest. Normally it is very full and you don't find a space to rest. The food and drinks a little expensive. But the temperature and the plants are great. And there is a
            new activity you can do.</p>
